= sinatra-respond_to

* http://www.github.com/cehoffman/sinatra-respond_to

== DESCRIPTION:

A respond_to style Rails block for baked-in web service support in Sinatra

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Handles setting charset for appropriate types
* Handles setting the content type depending on what is being served
* Automatically can adjust XMLHttpRequests to return Javascript

== SYNOPSIS:

    require 'sinatra'
    require 'sinatra/respond_to'
    
    Sinatra::Application.register Sinatra::RespondTo

    get '/posts' do
      @posts = Post.recent

      respond_to do |wants|
        wants.html { haml :posts }      # => views/posts.html.haml, also sets content_type to text/html
        wants.rss { haml :posts }       # => views/posts.rss.haml, also sets content_type to application/rss+xml
        wants.atom { haml :posts }      # => views/posts.atom.haml, also sets content_type to appliation/atom+xml
      end
    end

    get '/post/:id' do
      @post = Post.find(params[:id])

      respond_to do |wants|
        wants.html { haml :post }       # => views/post.html.haml, also sets content_type to text/html
        wants.xhtml { haml :post }      # => views/post.xhtml.haml, also sets content_type to application/xhtml+xml
        wants.xml { @post.to_xml }      # => sets content_type to application/xml
        wants.js { erb :post }          # => views/post.js.erb, also sets content_type to application/javascript
      end
    end

    get '/comments/:id' do
      @comment = Comment.find(params[:id])

      respond_to do |wants|
        wants.html { haml :comment }    # => views/comment.html.haml, also sets content_type to text/html
        wants.json { @comment.to_json } # => sets content_type to application/json
        wants.js { erb :comment }       # => views/comment.js.erb, also sets content_type to application/javascript
      end
    end

To change the character set of the response, there is a <tt>charset</tt> helper.  For example

    get '/iso-8859-1' do
      charset 'iso-8859-1'
      "This is now sent using iso-8859-1 character set"
    end

    get '/respond_to-mixed' do
      respond_to do |wants|
        wants.html { charset 'iso-8859-1'; "Some html in iso-8859-1" }
        wants.xml { builder :utf-8-xml }    # => this is returned in the default character set
      end
    end

== CONFIGURATION:

There a few options available for configuring the default behavior of respond_to using Sinatra's
<tt>set</tt> utility.

* <tt>default\_charset - utf-8</tt>
    Assumes all text documents are encoded using this character set.
    This can be overridden within the respond_to block for the appropriate format
* <tt>default\_content - :html</tt>
    When a user vists a url without an extension, for example /post this will be
    the assumed content to serve first.  Expects a symbol as used in setting content_type.
* <tt>assume\_xhr\_is\_js - true</tt>
    To avoid headaches with accept headers, and appending .js to urls, this will
    cause the default format for all XmlHttpRequests to be classified as wanting Javascript
    in the response.

== REQUIREMENTS:

* sinatra 0.9.4 - 1.0

== INSTALL:

* gem install sinatra-respond_to

== CAVEATS:
Due to the way respond\_to works, all incoming requests have the extension striped from the request.path\_info.
This causes routes like the following to fail.

    get '/style.css' do
      content_type :css, :charset => 'utf-8'
      sass :style   # => renders views/style.sass
    end

They need to be changed to the following.  Note that you no longer have to set the content\_type or charset.

    get '/style' do
      sass :style   # => renders views/style.css.sass
    end

If you want to ensure the route only gets called for css requests try this.  This will use sinatra's built in accept header matching.

    get '/style', :provides => :css do
      sass :style
    end
